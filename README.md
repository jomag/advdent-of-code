So I decided to pick this up Advent of Code again this year.
I started on the 10:th of december and have been doing on average
about 2 puzzles (4 stars) per day.

Up until today I've not run into big problems, but the second
part of day 16 is tricky to solve in reasonable time. So this
was the first time I had to read up on some ideas from Reddit,
and my solution is still not quite there yet.

For this year I've decided to use Go to for all tasks. I've
never used Go before so it took some time getting up to speed.
The language is very simplistic however, which made it easy
to learn, but I also think it was a bad choice for this type
of computing task with a big focus on algorithms.
